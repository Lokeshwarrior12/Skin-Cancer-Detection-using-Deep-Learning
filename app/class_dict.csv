0, Eczema,300,300,1,"Eczema is a skin condition that causes dry and itchy patches of skin. It’s a common condition that isn’t contagious. Symptoms of eczema can flare up if you contact an irritant or an allergen. There are treatments available to help you manage symptoms, but there isn’t a cure.","Dry skin,Itchy skin,Skin rash,Bumps on your skin,Thick& leathery patches of skin,Flaky& scaly or crusty skin,Swelling.
","Your treatment for eczema is unique to you and what caused your symptoms to flare up. Treatment for eczema could include:,Using gentle or sensitive skin moisturizers throughout the day when you have dry skin. Apply moisturizer when your skin is damp after a bath or shower,Apply topical medications to your skin as advised by your provider, like topical steroids,Take oral medications like anti-inflammatory medicine,antihistamines or corticosteroids to reduce itchiness and swelling,Immunosuppressant drugs help regulate how your immune system functions,Light therapy to improve the appearance of your skin and remove blemishes,Avoid triggers that cause symptoms of eczema to flare up."
1,Warts Molluscum and other Viral Infections ,300,300,1,"Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection that causes either single or multiple raised and skin-colored pearl-like bumps (papules) on the skin. The papules have indentations or dimples in their centers. Molluscum contagiosum is a chronic infection and lesions may persist from a few months to a few years. However, most cases resolve in six to nine months.","Common locations for the papules are on the faces, trunks and limbs of children. In adults, common locations are the genitals, abdomens, and inner thighs. The condition usually results in papules that:

Are generally painless, but can itch.
Are small (2 to 5 millimeter diameter). However, people with immunodeficiencies can develop larger lesions.
Have a dimple in the center.
Are initially firm, dome-shaped, and flesh-colored.
Become softer with time.
May turn red and drain over time.Have a central core of white, waxy material.","Diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is based on the distinctive appearance of the lesion. If the diagnosis is in question, a doctor can confirm the diagnosis with a skin biopsy (the removal of a portion of skin from a patient for diagnostic examination). If there is any concern about related health problems, a doctor can check for underlying disorders."
2,Melanoma ,300,300,1,"Melanoma is the most invasive skin cancer with the highest risk of death. While it’s a serious skin cancer, it's highly curable if caught early. Prevention and early treatment are critical, especially if you have fair skin, blonde or red hair and blue eyes.","Knowing how to spot melanoma is important because early melanomas are highly treatable. Melanoma can appear as moles, scaly patches, open sores or raised bumps. Another tool to recognize melanoma is the ugly duckling sign. If one of your moles looks different from the others, it’s the ugly duckling and should be seen by a dermatologist.","Treatments for melanoma:

Melanoma Surgery: In the early stages, surgery has a high probability of being able to cure your melanoma. Usually performed in an office, a dermatologist numbs the skin with a local anesthetic and removes the melanoma and margins (healthy surrounding skin).
Lymphadenectomy: In cases where melanoma has spread, removal of the lymph nodes near the primary diagnosis site may be required. This can prevent the spread to other areas of your body.
Metastasectomy: Metastasectomy is used to remove small melanoma bits from organs.
Targeted cancer therapy: In this treatment option, drugs are used to attack specific cancer cells. This “targeted” approach goes after cancer cells, leaving healthy cells untouched.
Radiation Therapy: Radiation therapy includes treatments with high-energy rays to attack cancer cells and shrink tumors.
Immunotherapy: immunotherapy stimulates your own immune system to help fight the cancer."
3,Atopic Dermatitis ,300,300,1,"Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin. It's common in young children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare sometimes. It can be irritating but it's not contagious.","Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include:

Dry, cracked skin
Itchiness (pruritus)
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
Oozing and crusting
Thickened skin
Darkening of the skin around the eyes
Raw, sensitive skin from scratching",Moisturizing regularly and following other skin care habits can relieve itching and prevent new outbreaks (flares). Treatment may also include medicated ointments or creams.
4,Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) ,300,300,1,Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells — a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off.,"Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. These changes in the skin (lesions) usually have one of the following characteristics:

A shiny, skin-colored bump that's translucent, meaning you can see a bit through the surface. The bump can look pearly white or pink on white skin. On brown and Black skin, the bump often looks brown or glossy black. Tiny blood vessels might be visible, though they may be difficult to see on brown and Black skin. The bump may bleed and scab over.
A brown, black or blue lesion — or a lesion with dark spots — with a slightly raised, translucent border.
A flat, scaly patch with a raised edge. Over time, these patches can grow quite large.
A white, waxy, scar-like lesion without a clearly defined border.",Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma.
5,Melanocytic Nevi (NV) ,300,300,1,"Giant congenital melanocytic nevus is a skin condition characterized by an abnormally dark, noncancerous skin patch (nevus) that is composed of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It is present from birth (congenital) or is noticeable soon after birth.","Symptoms of CMN include the presence of moles on the skin from birth or that appear in the first few months of life. These birthmarks range in color from light brown to black. They may darken, get thicker or grow hair as your child ages. They are usually painless.","Most melanocytic naevi are harmless and can be safely left alone. They may be removed in the following circumstances:

To exclude cancer
If a naevus is a nuisance: perhaps irritated by clothing, comb or razor
Cosmetic reasons: the mole is unsightly.
Surgical techniques include:

Excision biopsy of a flat or suspicious melanocytic naevus
Shave biopsy of a protruding melanocytic naevus
Electrosurgical destruction
Laser to lessen pigment or remove coarse hair."
6,Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL) ,300,300,1,"Seborrheic keratosis is a common benign (noncancerous) skin growth. It tends to appear in middle age and you may get more as you get older. Seborrheic keratoses are not pre-cancerous, but they can resemble other skin growths that are. ","They usually don’t, but people sometimes report:

Itching.
Irritation from friction.
Bleeding.
If these symptoms annoy you, you may want to have the growth removed.","Cryotherapy. Your healthcare provider will numb the skin and then use liquid nitrogen to freeze the growth. This will cause it to fall off within a few days or weeks. Cryotherapy is a common choice when the diagnosis is clear and there is no need to preserve a sample of the growth for biopsy. One possible side effect is that the skin where the growth was will lose some of its pigment and look lighter.
Electrodessication/Curettage. Your healthcare provider will numb the skin and then use a targeted electrocurrent to burn the seborrheic keratosis. They use a surgical instrument called a curette to scrape away the remains of the growth. Electrodessication and curettage are also sometimes used individually. The risk of scarring is generally low with both methods, but there is some wound care involved afterward."
7, Psoriasis pictures Lichen Planus and related diseases ,300,300,1,"The resulting rash can affect the skin on your arms, legs, scalp, nails, genital area and the inside of your mouth. For most people, it resolves without treatment. Some treatments can alleviate related symptoms, including itching.","Some mental/emotional signs of stress that can make your lichen planus symptoms worse include:

Depression.
Difficulty relaxing.
Use of alcohol, tobacco or drugs to relax.
A negative opinion of yourself (low self-esteem).
Anxiety (constant worry).
Feeling overwhelmed.
Difficulty concentrating.
Irritability, mood swings or a short temper.","Corticosteroid creams or ointments. Your healthcare provider may prescribe corticosteroid creams or ointments to reduce inflammation.
Antihistamines. Antihistamines are a class of drugs commonly used to treat allergy symptoms, including itchy skin.
Phototherapy. Phototherapy uses ultraviolet light, usually ultraviolet B (UVB), from special lamps. The ultraviolet light waves found in sunlight can help certain skin disorders, including lichen planus.
Immunosuppressants. Medications that lower your immune system such as oral corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine or cyclosporine can be helpful."
8, Seborrheic Keratoses and other Benign Tumors,300,300,1,"A seborrheic keratosis (seb-o-REE-ik ker-uh-TOE-sis) is a common noncancerous (benign) skin growth. People tend to get more of them as they get older.

Seborrheic keratoses are usually brown, black or light tan. The growths (lesions) look waxy or scaly and slightly raised. They appear gradually, usually on the face, neck, chest or back.","A seborrheic keratosis grows gradually. Signs and symptoms might include:

A round or oval-shaped waxy or rough bump, typically on the face, chest, a shoulder or the back
A flat growth or a slightly raised bump with a scaly surface, with a characteristic ""pasted on"" look
Varied size, from very small to more than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) across
Varied number, ranging from a single growth to multiple growths
Very small growths clustered around the eyes or elsewhere on the face, sometimes called flesh moles or dermatosis papulosa nigra, common on Black or brown skin
Varied in color, ranging from light tan to brown or black
Itchiness","Seborrheic keratoses are harmless and not contagious. They don't need treatment, but you may decide to have them removed if they become irritated by clothing or you don't like how they look."
9,Tinea Ringworm Candidiasis and other Fungal Infections ,300,300,1,"Ringworm is an itchy, contagious fungal infection that causes a ring-shaped pattern on your skin. Over-the-counter and prescription treatments can stop the fungus from spreading to other parts of your body or to others.","Despite its name, a fungus causes ringworm. This type of fungus naturally lives on your skin, hair and nails. However, when their environment gets hot and damp, the fungi start growing uncontrollably. You can get this infection anytime your skin comes into contact with the ringworm fungus on someone else’s skin.","Changing your socks and underwear daily or more frequently if they become damp or soiled.
Showering immediately after contact sports or exercise.
Wearing sandals or shower shoes at the pool and in public locker rooms and showers.
Drying your skin thoroughly after showering, especially between your toes.
Avoiding sharing towels, washcloths, sheets, clothes, combs or other personal hygiene items."
